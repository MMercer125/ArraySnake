# ArraySnake
A short practice example of working with arrays.

This project creates a simple animation using arrays to simulate a snake-like effect based on the mouse's position. The movement of the snake is driven by two arrays: xpos and ypos, 
which store the positions of the snake segments.

Features
Dynamic Snake Movement: The snake moves smoothly as it follows the mouse position.
Array-based Animation: The code uses two arrays (xpos and ypos) to store and update the positions of the snake's segments over time.
Visual Effect: The segments are drawn with varying sizes and colors to create a smooth trailing effect.
